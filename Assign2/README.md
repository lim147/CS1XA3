   <h3>Web App</h3>
   Flappy Circle is a funny game just same as Falppy Bird, but our character is a circle now :)!
   <br>
   Since this is no longer a phone game, tap is not available, but you could control your circle with the spacebar.
   <br>
   The link of the page is under "PROJECT" category of my CV webpage, prompted with "Web APP" text, or you could open it here:
