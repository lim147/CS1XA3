## Web App
   Flappy Circle is a funny game just same as Falppy Bird, but our main character is a circle now :)
 
   - Since it's no longer a phone game, tap is not available, but you could control your circle with the spacebar.

   - The link of the page is under "PROJECT" category of my CV webpage, or you could open it [here](http://ugweb.cas.mcmaster.ca/~lim147/flappy_circle.html)
