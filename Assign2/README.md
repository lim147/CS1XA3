See my CV webpage [here](http://ugweb.cas.mcmaster.ca/~lim147)

## Web App
   Flappy Circle is a funny game just same as Falppy Bird, but our character is a circle now :)!
 
   - Since this is no longer a phone game, tap is not available, but you could control your circle with the spacebar.

   - The link of the page is under "PROJECT" category of my CV webpage, prompted with "Web APP" text, or you could open it [here](http://ugweb.cas.mcmaster.ca/~lim147/web_app.html)
