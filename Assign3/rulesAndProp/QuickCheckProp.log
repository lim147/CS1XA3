Property:

1.Number plus negative itself equals 0
x + (-x) = 0

2.Check if `eval` works well on adding multiple constants together
eval (a + b + ...) = sum ([a,b,...])

3.Number times 0 equals 0
eval (expr * 0) = 0

4.Check if `simplify` could add up all the contents together
simplify (a + b + ...) = val (sum ([a,b,...]) 

5.Check if `simplify` could reduce an expression after timing 0 to 0
simplify (expr * 0) = val 0

6.Constant in an expr doesn't matter to the differentiation
partDiff "x" (x ^ 2 + c) == 2 * x

7.Partial derivative of a non-existing variable of an expr is 0
partDiff "z" (x ^ 2 + c) == 0

8.Exponentiation property:
(a ^ b) * (a ^ c) = a ^ (b+c)
