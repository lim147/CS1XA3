## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
##### 1.1.a Background 
The G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project is a capstone project for COMPSCI 4ZP6 at McMaster University. This project is developed by Team Ludus, a team that consists of five fourth-year Computer Science students from McMaster University under the supervision of [Sasha Soraine](@sorainsm). Completion of this capstone project is a mandatory requirement for graduation and also a process for students to apply their knowledge in a year long project.

Our capstone group is developing the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project, a project composed of five to ten single-player mini games designed in Unity, to measure approximately five out of 46 identified human cognitive and psychomotor skills. Each game will take players no more than a minute to play, and will be used to establish player competencies in a specific cognitive or psychomotor group. The structure of the games will be similar to minigame compilations like Mario Party.

##### 1.1.b Goals
The purpose of the capstone project is to give students an opportunity to apply and practice their knowledge learned through their university study experience to create a set of mini-games that could practice their creativity, teamwork, and technical skills. This will also let students participate in a full life-cycle of software development, which enhances the understanding of the software design process. 

The goal of the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project is to measure a subset of cognitive and motor abilities through the process of playing and enjoying the games.

##### 1.1.c Purpose
The purpose of this requirements document is to lay out who the stakeholders of this project are, the constraints and scope of the project, as well as the functional and non-functional requirements that need to be met to ensure the success of the project. In this way, this document serves as a contract between us, Team Ludus, and our stakeholders on what we will deliver to ensure our solution fully addresses the problem our stakeholders face, as laid out in our previous project summary document, all while ensuring we meet the many individual requirements that compose this problem.

### 1.2 Stakeholders
#### The Client
* [Dr. Jacques Carette](@carette): The professor for the Computer Science Capstone Project: COMPSCI 4ZP6. He establishes the requirements, milestones, deadlines, and other course-related objectives. He is also responsible for evaluating and grading the final project.

* Other students taking COMPSCI 4ZP6: The other students taking the capstone course will submit feedback and bug reports during the testing phase of the project.

#### Others
* Team Ludus: The developers of the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project. This team consists of five students enrolled in the Computer Science Capstone Project: COMPSCI 4ZP6. The final deliverable and the documents will be made by these team members who will also give a demo presentation of the project at the end of the semester to a panel of judges at the Faculty of Engineering Capstone Day.

* Team Mactivision: The other team working under our supervisor to develop a different set of mini-games for the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project. The members of this group include: [Bryan Chiu](@chiub1), [Sijie Zhou](@zhous16), [Kunyuan Cao](@caok10), [David Hospital](@hospitad), and [Mike Tee](@teemh). We will be collaborating with this group at a further stage of development in the project.

* Panel of judges: The judges will critique the final product during showcase at the Faculty of Engineering Capstone Day in early April. The panel consists of people with different backgrounds in computer science and game design.

### 1.3 Mandated Constraints

##### Solution Constraints
* The game must be developed using the Unity game development software.
* The game must be modular: a change of controller must not change the underlying test.
* Each mini-game should take players no more than one minute to finish.

##### Implementation Environment
* Computer System: The mini-games must be designed to be operating system independent.

* Input devices: The primary mode of input is the keyboard, and games must first be designed with this in mind.

* Output devices: The output device will be the computer monitor and speakers.

##### Partner or Collaborative Applications
* GitLab: Our ability to track issues and manage project progress will be limited to what is supported by GitLab.

* Microsoft Teams: Due to COVID-19, our team members are unable to meet in person, so our meeting collaboration has been limited to what is supported by Microsoft Teams.


##### Off-the-Shelf Software
* Unity: Game functionality will be limited to what is supported by the Unity platform.


##### Schedule Constraints
* All course deliverables must be completed on time according to the schedule provided by [Dr. Carette](@carette). The final project must be fully finished by April 5th.

##### Budget Constraints
* There are no budget constraints for this project. For the purposes of our project, we will not be paid nor will we need to pay for any software.

##### Final Product Constraints
* The final product must consist of several one-minute mini-games that will measure at least five cognitive and motor abilities from the set of identified cognitive and motor abilities.

### 1.4 Work Scope
##### Existing Inspirations
* [Super Mario Party](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-party-switch/) (Nintendo, 2018):  A party video game where players compete with each other while having fun by playing several small games to earn points. Unique challenges are designed in those small games that require different abilities to be successful. Games in the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project will be designed similarly to the mini-games found in Super Mario Party.
* [Cyclone](https://www.icegame.com/category/93/cyclone) (ICE, 1982): Arcade game designed for 1-3 players consisting of a circle of light up rings and lightbulbs. The rings and lightbulbs light up in some designated order, and the player must try to press a button when their desired ring or lightbulb lights up. Depending on the position of the light when the player presses the button, the player will get a score. Different positions give different points. This game tests the time to contact ability, as the player must watch as the lights approach their desired position, and press it when it reaches it.

##### Context of the Work
* The completion of this project is the focus of the course COMPSCI 4ZP6 and is a key requirement needed to graduate from the undergraduate computer science program at McMaster. 
* Beyond the end of the course, future work on the project could entail the development of further mini-games testing other abilities as well as the use of other input controllers apart from the keyboard.

### 1.5 Product Scope
##### Product Boundary
* The final product will be a series of mini-games consisting of at least five selected cognitive and motor abilities to be measured.
* The product will not be commercially sold and the platform will solely be laptop and desktop computers.
* Each mini-game is independent and has no continuity; players can choose which mini-game to start from freely.

##### Mini-Game Set
The G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project is a set of five games aimed to test the following abilities: object recognition, token change direction, time to contact, audial perception, and selective/focused visual. The game descriptions are as below:

###### Flip-Flop-Clear
A 2-D card game where 9 cards are placed face down on the screen in a 3 x 3 array. Each card has a different image, and three of the images on the cards are of the same type. For example, you could have a red apple card, a green apple card, and an apple tree card. When the player clicks on a card, the card flips over and the player can see its image. When the second card is turned over, if its image is of the same type as the first card, both cards remain face up, otherwise both cards go face down. The third card is flipped over in the same way. When a player has three cards' images of the same type all face up, this type of cards is cleared. To win the game, the player must clear all three types of cards. The object recognition ability is tested through the game as a player must recognize the object images on the cards and identify the objects of the same kind in a short amount of time.

###### Holy Sinkholes!
In this 2-D game, the user must dodge impending sinkholes that appear in the ground below them by carefully (and quickly!) moving left or right. The user will be given an indication that a sinkhole is about to appear, but this indication will be short, so they will have to choose the direction they move towards very quickly. Moreover, if the user moves all the way to one side of the screen, they will appear on the opposite side, so it is not possible to seek shelter and the player is always on the move. As an added gameplay challenge, once the user has been successful in dodging the sinkholes for long enough, garbage asteroids will begin falling vertically from the top of the screen. The user must then dodge both the the sinkholes below them *and* the asteroids coming from above them by moving in the correct direction quickly. Token change direction is tested through this game by seeing if the user chooses the correct direction to move towards and how quickly they can decide to change their player's direction in order to meet the objective of the game.

###### Green Light Go
In this game, which is inspired by the arcade game Cyclone, the user is presented with a top-down view of a circular game area. Along the perimeter of this circle, there are numerous light bulbs spaced evenly apart. One of these light bulbs is designated as the target. When the game begins, the light bulbs light up sequentially such that only one light bulb is lit at any given moment in time. The goal of the game is to have the user press a key on the keyboard to stop the light when it hits the target light bulb. The score that the user receives is directly related to how close the light bulb the light stopped at is to the target bulb. As an added gameplay challenge, the speed that the bulbs light up can get quicker. This game tests the time-to-contact of the player as it measures the user's hand-eye coordination and how quickly the user can press a button when indicated to do so.

###### Pianist
A music game where each key represents a musical note and the player is asked to listen to a section of music and repeat the tune through pressing the keyboard. The music will be slow and simple for the first several rounds; as the gameplay challenge increases, it will become faster and more complex. More complex tunes will consist of more notes and notes which are closer in pitch. The final score will depend on the correct number of musical notes and the correct order of these notes between the expected tune and player's inputs. This game will test the ability of audial perception and measures how accurately they can repeat the music by remembering the melody.


###### Cup Swap
An object will be displayed to the player, and then it will be put under a cup. There are two other identical cups, but with nothing under it. The three cups will swap positions for a short duration, then the player must choose the cup that they think has the object under it. The selective visual ability is tested as the player tries to keep track of the location of the cup containing the object. The speed of the swapping will increase and more cups will be introduced in later rounds.

## 2. Product Overview
Our product is composed of a series of small video games that focuses on five select cognitive abilities out of [46 identified human cognitive and psychomotor requirements](#111-identified-cognitive-and-motor-abilities) associated with video game challenges: object recognition, token change direction, time to contact, audial perception, and selective visual. Each individual game will focus primarily on one of the five selected abilities. The games will be accessible by the players through a web application that runs on a web server, and collects input through the keyboard and mouse. The input collected by the web application will be used to establish an ability baseline for the player, and to determine how parameter changes in the atomic challenges affect mechanical achievability and mechanical difficulty. The research results from the product will be used to contribute to the creation of innovative approaches in future game development and will bring about a greater understanding of the underlying science behind video games.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The G-ScalE project has existing research by [Sasha Soraine](@sorainsm), who has created a framework for identifying atomic challenges in video games and hypotheses about the mechanical experiences of video games.  Our capstone group is one of two groups that will be working on products to test and further the hypotheses and research already done. The two groups will be sharing the backend framework and will design and implement it such that the video game designs from both groups adhere to it.  The video game designs will reference existing test methods and research of the selected cognitive abilities to design video games that can be used to test and capture data related to the cognitive abilities.

### 2.2 Product Functions
* User must understand how to navigate through the application using the user interface
* User must understand how to play the game
* The user should be able to complete each mini game without major software errors that prevent the user from completing the game
* The mini game must be completed in under a minute
* Sufficient data should be able to be collected from each mini game

### 2.3 Product Constraints

The only external devices that can be used to collect user data at this point in time is the computer keyboard and computer mouse, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As such, our product's software must be accessed as a web application that can be reached using a standard internet browser on a laptop or desktop.

### 2.4 User Characteristics
* Proficient with use of a computer mouse and computer keyboard
* Able to read and understand the instructions of the game
* Has access to the internet and has a browser that can run the web application
* Has a computer mouse and computer keyboard
* Player is a generic able-bodied neurotypical person, a player with
normative motor and cognitive abilities

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

* Free-to-use assets from the Unity asset store will remain free to use during project implementation and after project completion
* The license requirements for the software being developed and Unity do not change
* The expectations required by the project lead do not change
* The product will not be commercially released
* Game assets may come from third party resources
* There exist effective methods to measure a subset of the cognitive and motor abilities using the keyboard only as the main input device

| **Description**          | Players must be able to move only in the left or right direction using two distinct keys on the keyboard for the game Holy Sinkholes!  |
| **Rationale**            | We are testing the token change direction ability, so we want to reduce the possible directions the user can move in as much as possible. The simplest approach is to only allow the user to change directions in a binary fashion: from left to right or right to left.

| **Rationale**            | We are testing the token change direction ability, so we want the player to continuously make decisions about direction. By warping the player's character, we force players to be continuously on the move. | 
| **Fit Criterion**         | The player's character gets warped to the opposite side of the screen when the character is moved to one of the screen's edges. |

| **Description**          | The sink holes and garbage asteroids must appear in random locations of the screen during gameplay in the game Holy Sinkholes! |
| **Rationale**            | We want to record how stimuli in the game (the sinkholes and asteroids) affect the player's decision to move left and right and how quickly they can perform this action. If we do not randomize the location of sinkholes and asteroids, then the player can simply memorize which direction they should move towards during gameplay, defeating the purpose of our measurements.   |

| **Rationale**            | We want to determine how well the user can change the direction of the character to avoid obstacles. If there comes a point where there is no such possible way for the user to avoid the obstacles, then we cannot objectively determine how well the user performed since any move they would have made would have resulted in the game ending.  |
| **Fit Criterion**         | There must always be a way for the user to move from their current, by moving left and right, to avoid the sinkholes and asteroids in the game Holey Sinkholes.   |

| **Rationale**            | Mini-games are meant to be short bursts of gameplay. If we ask the user to wait too long to end up playing a mini-game for only a small period of time anyway, their subjective satisfaction will be lowered, and they will be less eager to play the mini-game in the future.  |

| **Rationale**            | As games become more complex, the user is presented with more gameplay challenges simultaneously, making it harder to clearly measure individual abilities from one another. For this reason, a mini-game should have limited gameplay mechanics and should be designed *around* an ability in mind rather than designing the game first and then trying to add ways to measure an ability.  |

| **Description**          | The input controller when playing the mini-games will be limited to a computer keyboard.    |
| **Rationale**            | Due to COVID-19, again we can only reasonably expect that users will have access to a laptop or desktop computer with a web browser, ruling out console controllers and gamepads. We are not considering the mouse as on a laptop, users have trackpads rather than the moveable mice used with desktop computers. Even among desktop mice, designs and ergonomics differ radically, limiting our ability to perform universal mouse measurements.  |

### 3.5 Design and Implementation

#### 3.5.1 Installation
The mini-games will be provided through the web browser, so no installation of software itself is required to run the games.

However, to make sure the games can run stably on a player's web browser, a standard environment has the following requirements:

1. A web server is required to serve the requested pages to the client browser
2. Some necessary add-ons, extensions might need to be enabled.


#### 3.5.2 Distribution
We will host a website through which our Unity games can be played by our players. The games will be distributed primarily via this website, while other export options that Unity supports, such as dedicated game executables, might be used to distribute the game for testing purposes during development.

Any user that visits our website will be able to play our game.


#### 3.5.3 Maintainability
The initial mini-game set will be available on web browsers, where the keyboard is the main interaction tool. The back-end framework will be designed to be platform and interface independent. This controller agnostic framework will make our games easier to maintain as extra controllers can be supported in the future with minimal work needed.

In future versions, games can be extended to enable player interaction through additional interfaces: computer mice, touch pads, and joy-cons.

The framework we build to measure specific cognitive and motor abilities are built with maintainability in mind. For instance, by developing a method to measure token change direction, our work can be used to support  future mini-games apart from Holy Sinkhole that also make use of this ability.

#### 3.5.4 Reusability

The mini games will be designed in a modular way where the framework on interfaces, backend and ability measurement methods will be reused across the whole game design process.

The two groups who are contributing to the Mini-Game Battery Project will collaborate on a backend that can be reused for the creation of additional mini-games in the future. The data collected by our mini games can be used in future cognitive and motor ability testing research and in the development of future versions of the web application.


#### 3.5.5 Portability
The project is platform and interface independent. The web browser games can be run on any mid-range modern computer of all major operating systems.


#### 3.5.6 Cost
There will be no charge for the mini-games.  As the games are designed to help [Sasha](@sorainsm)’s research, we would like more players to get involved and provide rich testing data. For this reason, we cannot charge our players to play the games or we risk shrinking our audience substantially. 

In the game design process, we will use open-source software so there are no firm costs associated with the project. However, if the group decides to allocate money to purchase assets then those will fall into this domain. The paid assets could be: Unity assets, web server costs, as well as other interfaces that end up testing for use in our games, such as joycons, Wii remotes, and XBox controllers.

Labour would be a non-monetary cost. The project is scheduled to take 8 months to complete by five fourth year Computer Science undergraduate students. The expected working time is approximately 8 hours per week.

#### 3.5.8 Proof of Concept
TODO: add sketches

Prototypes will be used to build initial versions of solutions that implement core functionalities and serve as a proof of concept for verification and possibility of feature extension.



## 4. Verification
##### Interface Verification
For the verification of interface requirements, user surveys would be a relatively effective way. Especially in the user interface related parts, the user's feelings about the content helps us determine whether our requirements are met. Questionnaire surveys are a feasible solution. This can be done when the player finishes playing each mini-game. After enough user feedback is collected, we can summarize this information to determine whether the requirements are satisfied.   

For example, requirement EU-1 describes that "more than 85% of players can master these games through the introduction of rules or simple tutorials." So the questionnaire can ask the player whether he/she feels that it is easy to control the game.     

For hardware and software requirements, user surveys would also be important. Asking players the details of their operating system and PC is helpful for us to measure whether these games meet requirements well. On the other hand, during the development phase, our team will try to use different machines to test the web application and make sure that the requirements are met.

##### Function Verification
For the verification of functional requirements, the verification of the code is the main part of our work. A considerable degree of static testing will be carried out in the initial stage. By analyzing or checking the grammar, structure, process, and interface of the source program, we can have a rough estimate of whether the program completes the results expected by the requirements.

Dynamic testing will also be widely used in the later stage, checking the difference between the actual results and the expected results, and analyzing the performance indicators such as running efficiency, correctness and robustness, so that our code of mini games will be an optimized result.

Unit testing is essential for the analysis of each requirement. This method checks the correctness of these requirements. In this way, the correctness and completeness of each individual requirement can be checked, which partially ensures that the game runs in line with our initial expectations.

Integration testing as well as system testing will also be applied to verify the connection between components and the compliance of the system, to ensure that the web application running properly as a whole. 

Beta/Acceptance testing will be performed after most of our functional requirement testing has been completed, to test for usability, accessibility, understandability requirements, and learning requirements. Such testing will also find remaining bugs or issues specific to a player's environment. This will be done by the other students in the 4ZP6 capstone course.

We will say that a cognitive or motor ability measurement function is correct if the measured results of an individual reflect their aptitude in this ability as measured by an accepted test from a reputable study. We will say that these functions accurately reflect aptitudes if we receive confirmation from [Sasha](@sorainsm) indicating this.

| Priority | High |




## 7. Risks
* Time allocation: We might not balance time equally on each portion of the project. As a result, one common problem is that not enough time is allocated to testing the project.
* The amount of collected data: We may not have a great amount of players to play the game, resulting in a lack of data.
* Lack of diverse player backgrounds: Most of our play testers will also be members of our capstone course, which may limit the background profiles and diverseness of the players who are playing our game. This may result in missing data for a particular demographic.
* Ability measurement mechanism: The measurement standards we come up with may not quantify the motor and cognitive abilities very well, which could result in inaccurate testing results. For example, players with different levels of competency do not differ in the testing results.
* The fitness of game and testing abilities: The collected data from the games may not directly reflect the ability aimed to test, or be affected by other factors not accounted for.


## 8. User Documentation And Training
### 8.1 User Documentation Requirements
Documentation will be provided to outline the features, gameplay, game controls and other necessary background information.

### 8.2 Training Requirements
At the beginning of the game, a quick-start tutorial will be provided to illustrate the features and the controls. Other than that, no outside training will be required. 

Additionally, at the beginning of each mini-game the user will be provided with instructions pertaining to how to play the mini-game in question.

## 9. Waiting Room Features
Currently, each game will take no more than 60 seconds to play. With the consideration of the length and difficulty level of each mini-game itself, it may not be necessary to design gameplay that is impossible to achieve by a majority of the players.
* Added game challenges could be adjusted in the process of implementation and testing. 

As the only required interface by the client is the keyboard, due to time constraints mandated, the project deadline, the extended interfaces such as joycons, Wii remotes, and XBox controllers might not be implemented by April 5, 2021.

## 10. Ideas For Solutions
* We have proposed a [set of five mini-games that measure the five abilities we seek](#mini-game-set). We have included in these proposed mini-games gameplay mechanics and added challenges.
* Making use of free resources from Unity asset store to reduce the time spent designing graphics.
* Designing the games in a modular way to reuse the components across the whole development process.
