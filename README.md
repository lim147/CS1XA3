## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
##### 1.1.a Background 
The G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project is a capstone project for COMPSCI 4ZP6 at McMaster University. This project is developed by Team Ludus, a team that consists of five fourth-year Computer Science students from McMaster University under the supervision of Sasha Soraine. Completion of this capstone project is a mandatory requirement for graduation and also a process for students to apply their knowledge in a year long project.

Our capstone group is developing the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project, a project composed of five to ten single-player mini games designed in Unity, to measure approximately five out of 46 identified human cognitive and psychomotor skills. Each game will take players no more than a minute to play, and will be used to establish player competencies in a specific cognitive or psychomotor group. The structure of the games will be similar to minigame compilations, like Mario Party.

##### 1.1.b Goals
The purpose of the capstone project is to give students an opportunity to apply and practice their knowledge learned through their university study experience to create a set of mini-games that could practice their creativity, teamwork, and technical skills. This will also let students participate in a full life-cycle of software development, which enhances the understanding of the software design process. 

The goal of the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project is to measure a subset of cognitive and motor abilities through the process of playing and enjoying the games.

##### 1.1.c Purpose
The purpose of this requirements document is to lay out who the stakeholders of this project are, the constraints and scope of the project, as well as the functional and non-functional requirements that need to be met to ensure the success of the project. In this way, this document serves as a contract between us, Team Ludus, and our stakeholders on what we will deliver to ensure our solution fully addresses the problem our stakeholders face, as laid out in our previous project summary document, all while ensuring we meet the many individual requirements that compose this problem.

### 1.2 Stakeholders
#### The Client
* Dr. Jacques Carette: The professor for the Computer Science Capstone Project: COMPSCI 4ZP6. He establishes the requirements, milestones, deadlines, and other course-related objectives. He is also responsible for evaluating and grading the final project.

* Sasha Soraine: A PhD. Candidate in the Department of Computing and Software at McMaster University. She is our supervisor for the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project. She will provide us with detailed information and requirements about the project and assist us in finishing the challenges during the development process.


* Ethan Chan and Brendan Fallon: These are the TAs for COMPSCI 4ZP6. They will be responsible for grading and providing feedback on project deliverables.


#### The User Group
* Players: The people who will be playing the mini-games, consisting of people of different ages. They will participate in gameplay designed to provide data that we will measure to extract cognitive and motor ability aptitudes.

* Other students taking COMPSCI 4ZP6: The other students taking the capstone course will submit feedback and bug reports during the testing phase of the project.

#### Others
* Team Ludus: The developers of the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project. This team consists of five students enrolled in the Computer Science Capstone Project: COMPSCI 4ZP6. The final deliverable and the documents will be made by these team members who will also give a demo presentation of the project at the end of the semester to a panel of judges at the Faculty of Engineering Capstone Day.

* Team Mactivision: The other team working under our supervisor to develop a different set of mini-games for the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project. The members of this group include: Bryan Chiu, Sijie Zhou, Kunyuan Cao, David Hospital, and Mike Tee. We will be collaborating with this group at a further stage of development in the project.

* Panel of judges: The judges will critique the final product during showcase at the Faculty of Engineering Capstone Day in early April. The panel consists of people with different backgrounds in computer science and game design.

### 1.3 Mandated Constraints

##### Solution Constraints
* The game must be developed using the Unity game development software.
* The game must be modular: a change of controller must not change the underlying test.
* Each mini-game should take players no more than one minute to finish.

##### Implementation Environment
* Computer System: The mini-games must be designed to be operating system independent.

* Input devices: The primary mode of input is the keyboard, and games must first be designed with this in mind.

* Output devices: The output device will be the computer monitor and speakers.

##### Partner or Collaborative Applications
* GitLab: Our ability to track issues and manage project progress will be limited to what is supported by GitLab.

* Microsoft Teams: Due to COVID-19, our team members are unable to meet in person, so our meeting collaboration has been limited to what is supported by Microsoft Teams.


##### Off-the-Shelf Software
* Unity: Game functionality will be limited to what is supported by the Unity platform.


##### Schedule Constraints
* All course deliverables must be completed on time according to the schedule provided by Dr. Carette. The final project must be fully finished by April 5th.

##### Budget Constraints
* There are no budget constraints for this project. For the purposes of our project, we will not be paid nor will we need to pay for any software.

##### Final Product Constraints
* The final product must consist of several one-minute mini-games that will measure at least five cognitive and motor abilities from the set of identified cognitive and motor abilities.

### 1.4 Work Scope
##### Existing Inspirations
* Super Mario Party (Nintendo, 2018):  A party video game where players compete with each other while having fun by playing several small games to earn points. Unique challenges are designed in those small games that require different abilities to be successful. Games in the G-ScalE Mini-Game Battery Project will be designed similarly to the mini-games found in Super Mario Party.

##### Context of the Work
* The completion of this project is the focus of the course COMPSCI 4ZP6 and is a key requirement needed to graduate from the undergraduate computer science program at McMaster. 
* Beyond the end of the course, future work on the project could entail the development of further mini-games testing other abilities as well as the use of other input controllers apart from the keyboard.

### 1.5 Product Scope
##### Product Boundary
* The final product will be a series of mini-games consisting of at least five selected cognitive and motor abilities to be measured.
* The product will not be commercially sold and the platform will solely be laptop and desktop computers.
* Each mini-game is independent and has no continuity; players can choose which mini-game to start from freely.

##### Mini-Game Set
<TO DO>

1. Meijing [name]: A card game where 9 cards(3 x 3) face down on the screen. Each card has one of three kind of objects. The image on the card of the same kind could vary but they are related. When the player clicks on the card, the card flips over and the player can see what is the object on the card. When flipping over the second card, if the object belongs to the same kind of the first card, the both cards remain face up, otherwise both cards face down. Same for the third card. When the players have three cards in the same object all face up, this object is cleared. To win the game, the player must clear all three objects.


2. [Jack] Sinkhole game: The user has to move out of the way of an impending sinkhole by moving left or right. They can see that a sinkhole is about to appear and have to move left or right to avoid.


3. [Yunfei] [name]: Row of lights that light up sequentially, and you must press a button when the light reaches green (For example)


4. [Shuo] [name]: a piano game where each key represents a musical note and the player is asked to listen to a section of music and duplicate that through pressing the keyboard. 


5. [Alice] [name]: One object will be displayed, and then it will be put in a cup with two other identical cups. The three cups will be swapped, the player will need to find the correct cup with that object.

### 1.8 Document Overview
The rest of this document will be divided into 4 parts. The first part is the product overview which consists of topics such as the product perspective, functions, and constraints. This part describes information about the general factors of the product and requirements. The second part describes the requirements related to the external interface, functional requirements, and quality of service. This part illustrates the detailed and specific requirements of the product. The third part relates to verification which provides the verification approaches and methods that are going to determine whether the software is successful at solving the problems posed by the stakeholders. The last part describes the appendix.


## 2. Product Overview
Our product is composed of a series of small video games that focuses on five select cognitive abilities out of 46 identified human cognitive and psychomotor requirements associated with video game challenges: object recognition, token change direction, time to contact, audial perception, and selective visual. Each individual game will focus primarily on one of the five selected abilities. The games will be accessible by the players through a web application that runs on a web server, and collects input through the keyboard and mouse. The input collected by the web application will be used to establish an ability baseline for the player, and to determine how parameter changes in the atomic challenges affect mechanical achievability and mechanical difficulty. The research results from the product will be used to contribute to the creation of innovative approaches in future game development and will bring about a greater understanding of the underlying science behind video games.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The G-ScalE project has existing research by Sasha Soraine, who has created a framework for identifying atomic challenges in video games and hypotheses about the mechanical experiences of video games.  Our capstone group is one of two groups that will be working on products to test and further the hypotheses and research already done. The two groups will be sharing the backend framework and will design and implement it such that the video game designs from both groups adhere to it.  The video game designs will reference existing test methods and research of the selected cognitive abilities to design video games that can be used to test and capture data related to the cognitive abilities.



### 2.2 Product Functions

Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.)

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

* Free-to-use assets from the Unity asset store will remain free to use during project implementation and after project completion
* The license requirements for the software being developed and Unity do not change
* The expectations required by the project lead do not change
* The product will not be commercially released
* Game assets may come from third party resources
* There exist effective methods to measure a subset of the cognitive and motor abilities using the keyboard only as the main input device

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
SKIP FOR NOW
(Apportion the software requirements to software elements. For requirements that will require implementation over multiple software elements, or when allocation to a software element is initially undefined, this should be so stated. A cross reference table by function and software element should be used to summarize the apportioning.

Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system (e.g., blocks and/or increments).)

## 3. Requirements
> This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

> The specific requirements should:
* Be uniquely identifiable.
* State the subject of the requirement (e.g., system, software, etc.) and what shall be done.
* Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
* Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
* Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
* Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.

### 3.1 External Interfaces

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.

| **Rationale**            | Mini-games are meant to be short bursts of gameplay. If we ask the user to wait too long to end up playing a mini-game for only a small period of time anyway, their subjective satisfaction will be lowered, and they will be less eager to play the mini-game in the future.  |

Such information includes (but is not limited to): device IP address, device MAC address, individual identifying browser cookies, and ad tracking identifiers.   |
| **Rationale**            | We want our end-users to feel safe when playing our games. The information we generate from the games can reveal an individual's aptitude at a particular motor or cognitive skill, which might be above or below that of the general population.

### 3.5 Design and Implementation

#### 3.5.1 Installation
Mini games will be provided on web browsers so no installation on software itself is required to run the games.

But to make sure the games could run stably on your web browser, a standard mini-games running environment has the following requirements:

1. A web server is required to serve the requested pages to the client browser
2. Adobe, Flash should be enabled to load the games.


(Constraints to ensure that the software-to-be will run smoothly on the target implementation platform.)

#### 3.5.2 Distribution
Constraints on software components to fit the geographically distributed structure of the host organization, the distribution of data to be processed, or the distribution of devices to be controlled.

#### 3.5.3 Maintainability
The initial mini-game set will be released to only available on web browsers, where keyboard is the main interaction tool. The initial Mini-Game set will be released by early February, 2021.

In the next step, games will be upgraded to enable player interaction through more accessory tools: mouses, touch pads, and joy-cons. To do this, an upgrade on game interfaces, back-end frameworks will be done in March, 2021 and Mini-Game Battery 2.0 will be released by the Capstone material deadline, which is April 4th, 2021.

After the graded presentation, there will be no further updates to the game.


(Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of maintenance of the software itself. These may include requirements for certain modularity, interfaces, or complexity limitation. Requirements should not be placed here just because they are thought to be good design practices.)

#### 3.5.4 Reusability
<!-- TODO: come up with a description -->

The mini games will be designed in a modular way where the framework on interfaces, backend and ability measurement methods will be reused across the whole game design process.

At a later stage, two groups who do the same Mini-Game Battery Project will collaborate on the backend. In this way, collected data will also be shared and reused in the ability testing process.


#### 3.5.5 Portability
The project is platform and interface independent. The web browser games can be run on any PC of all modes in different operating systems.

(Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of porting the software to other host machines and/or operating systems.)

#### 3.5.6 Cost
There will be no charge on the mini games. As the games are designed to help Sasha’s research, we would like more players to get involved and provide rich testing data. 
In the game design process, we will use open source software so there are no firm costs associated with the project. However, if the group decides to allocate money to purchase assets then those will fall into this domain. The paid assets could be: url for the web games, accessories such as mouses, joycons.
Labour would be a non-monetary cost. The project is scheduled to take 8 months to complete by five 4th year CS undergraduate students. The expected working time is approximately 8 hours per week.

Risks:
* Time allocation: We may not balance time on each portion in the accomplishment of the project. One common problem is that not enough testing is applied to the project.
* Ability measurement: The measure standards we come up with may not quantify the motor and cognitive abilities very well, which could result in inaccurate testing results.
* The fitness of game and testing abilities: The collected data from the games may not directly reflect the ability aimed to test.


## User documentation and training:
### User documentation Requirements:
Documentation will be provided to outline the features, gameplay, game controls and other necessary background information.

### Training requirements:
At the beginning of the game, a quick-start tutorial will be provided to illustrate the features and the controls. Other than that, no outside training will be required. 

## Waiting room features:
Each game will cost no more than 60 seconds to play. Considering the time constraints and difficulty level, some component might not be fully developed:
* ……. (map to the previous functionality section)

## Ideas for solutions:
* Making use of free resources from Unity asset store to reduce the time consuming on interface design.
* Designing the games in a module way to reuse the component across the whole development process.
