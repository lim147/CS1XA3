   <h3>Web App</h3>
   It's a simple animation using the knowledge of the Elm architecture functionality. The main part is a little red circle moving along a "flower" shaped path (path equation is<i> r=1+3*sin(2*Î¸)^2</i>). The speed of the movement can be changed in 2 ways:
   <ol>
      <li>click anywhere on the screen to make it faster
      <li>click the <i>faster</i> or <i>lower</i> button to adjust it
   </ol>
